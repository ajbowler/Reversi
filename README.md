Reversi written in Unity

The game is a 1 player game against an AI. The player can select a color (black always goes first) and set the difficulty for the AI from 1 to 10. This difficulty corresponds to how many moves ahead the AI will look before making a move.

Background music is "The 4-9 Evening Shift", composed and performed by me. The song can be found [here](https://soundcloud.com/ajbowler/the-4-9-evening-shift).
